## About the Collection

This collection contains photographs of the Marcellino family of Baltimore, MD. It is particularly focused on photographs of significant events in the family's history, including but not limited to weddings, travel, and graduations. It is my hope that current and future generations of the family will add to this collection so that our story can continue to be told.
